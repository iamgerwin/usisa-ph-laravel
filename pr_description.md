# Pull Request: Data Scraper System Implementation

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive data scraper system for government project data sources with Strategy Pattern architecture, database-driven configuration, and Filament admin panel integration. Successfully scraped and imported 11,000+ projects from DIME.gov.ph.

## Key Features

### 1. Scraper Architecture
- **Strategy Pattern Implementation**: Flexible architecture supporting multiple data sources
- **Base Scraper Strategy**: Abstract class with common functionality for HTTP clients, rate limiting, and error handling
- **DIME Scraper Strategy**: Specific implementation for DIME.gov.ph with Next.js SSR data extraction

### 2. Database Schema
- **scraper_sources table**: Stores configuration for each data source
- **scraper_jobs table**: Tracks job progress with detailed statistics
- **projects table enhancements**: Added DIME-specific fields for complete data capture
- **PHP Enums**: Created ScraperJobStatus enum for type safety and code readability

### 3. Laravel Command
- Comprehensive `scrape:data` command with options:
  - `--source`: Select data source
  - `--start/--end`: Define ID range
  - `--chunk`: Batch processing size
  - `--delay`: Rate limiting between requests
  - `--retry`: Retry attempts for failed requests
  - `--resume`: Resume from last failed/paused job
  - `--dry-run`: Test mode without database writes
- Real-time progress tracking
- Graceful error handling and recovery

### 4. Filament Admin Integration
- **Scraper Sources Management**: Add/edit configurations, field mappings, rate limits
- **Scraper Jobs Monitoring**: View progress, statistics, error logs
- **Run Scraper Action**: Launch scrapers directly from admin panel
- **Project Form Enhancements**: 
  - Fixed Filament v4 namespace compatibility issues
  - Fixed contractors relationship column name
  - Enhanced metadata display to show JSON instead of [object Object]

### 5. Data Processing
- Handles all DIME.gov.ph fields including:
  - Implementing offices
  - Contractors
  - Source of funds
  - Programs (auto-created if not existing)
  - Location hierarchy (Region → Province → City → Barangay)
  - Project metadata with proper JSON formatting

## Technical Improvements
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses both dime_id and project_code for matching
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable requests per second with automatic throttling
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Memory Management**: Batch processing with configurable chunk sizes
- **Progress Tracking**: Database updates and console progress bars

## Testing & Results
- Successfully scraped and imported 11,337+ projects from DIME.gov.ph
- Handles Next.js SSR responses by extracting JSON from __NEXT_DATA__ script tags
- Processes ~100 projects per minute with proper rate limiting
- Comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms

## Documentation
- Created detailed SCRAPER_DOCUMENTATION.md with:
  - Architecture overview
  - Command usage examples
  - Admin panel instructions
  - Adding new data sources guide
  - Troubleshooting section

## Files Changed
- Created 15+ new files for scraper system
- Modified existing models and migrations
- Fixed multiple Filament v4 compatibility issues
- Enhanced Project model with relationships and DIME fields

## Future Enhancements
- Queue-based processing for larger datasets
- Webhook notifications for job completion
- API endpoint for programmatic access
- Scheduled scraping via Laravel scheduler
- Data validation and quality checks
