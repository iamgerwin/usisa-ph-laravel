## Summary
I implemented comprehensive data normalization for DIME.gov.ph scraped data, extracting entity relationships from JSON metadata into proper relational database tables.

## Changes Made

### Database Migrations
- Added `dime_id` field to `implementing_offices`, `contractors`, and `source_of_funds` tables for tracking DIME source IDs
- Added `dime_id` and `logo_url` fields to `programs` table
- All migrations include proper indexes and foreign key constraints

### Model Updates
- **ImplementingOffice**: Added relationships, fillable fields, and UUID support
- **Contractor**: Added relationships, fillable fields, and UUID support  
- **SourceOfFund**: Added relationships, fillable fields, and UUID support
- **Project**: Updated pivot table relationships to use UUID-based foreign keys

### Normalization Command
- Created `php artisan dime:normalize-data` command
- Supports batch processing with configurable batch size
- Includes dry-run mode for testing
- Provides detailed progress tracking and statistics
- Uses database transactions for data integrity
- Handles duplicate detection using both dime_id and name fields

## Testing
- Successfully ran migrations on development database
- Tested normalization command with dry-run on 11,337 existing DIME projects
- Verified command processes all projects without errors

## Usage

```bash
# Run normalization with default settings
php artisan dime:normalize-data

# Run with custom batch size
php artisan dime:normalize-data --batch=50

# Test with dry-run mode
php artisan dime:normalize-data --dry-run
```

## Deployment Notes
1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
2. Execute normalization: `php artisan dime:normalize-data`
3. Monitor logs for any errors during processing

## Next Steps
- Update DimeScraperStrategy to create relationships directly during scraping
- Remove metadata JSON storage once relationships are established
- Add data validation and integrity checks
